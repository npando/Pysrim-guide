If that requirement is already satisfied, then pysrim can simply be installed by running the command \"pip install pysrim\" in the terminal. Then pysrim can be imported by running the below commands."

    "Now it is time to give the input parameters for TRIM. This is by far the most important part of running the simulation. If you don't do this part correctly, you'll likely have to start the simulation over, as many of paramters inputted here cannot be modified in the TRIM window. The full documentation of the parameters that can be put into the TRIM function can be found at: https://pysrim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/srim.html#srim.srim.TRIMSettings. Within the function, you first input the target and ion that you defined above. Next, specify the number of ions you wish to simulate. For the type of calculation you wish to do, read the documentation linked above about which number you need to specify. To learn more about what the different damage calculations are, consult chapter 8 of the SRIM textbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you need to tell TRIM whether it should include the COLLISON.txt and EXYZ.txt files. These are by far the most information files, so make sure to include then. Note that you can only produce the COLLISON.txt files for certain types of damage calculations. Calculation types 2 and 3 should do the trick. To include the COLLISON.txt file, simply set collisions=True. For the EXYZ.txt file you simply need to tell it the energy interval that it should take data at. To learn more about the capabilities of these files, consult chapters 8 and 9 of the SRIM textbook. "

Once you've specfied everything above, simply specify the path to where SRIM is installed on your computer and then input that into the trim.run function. If everything ran correctly, you should see the TRIM window pop up and start calculating. One final thing to mention, if you wish to obtain the COLLISON.txt type C file, there is only one way that I know of to do this. Immediatly as the TRIM calculation, hit the button at the top that say \"Pause TRIM\" to pause the calculation. Then towards the bottom left corner of the window, above where it says 3d plots, you should see a little box called \"Collision Details\". It should already be checked. You need to uncheck then recheck the box. You should get two prompts, one about wanting to keep data about recoils, respond yes to both. TRIM should now produce the type C file. If you dont do any of this, TRIM will produce a type B file."

You'll likely to find it in the directory called \"SRIM Outputs\". You'll likely need to manually transfer this one over to where everything else is stored. If you don't do this by the next time you run a simulation, the file will be overwritten and you'll lose all of the data stored in the EXYZ.txt file from your last simulation :( . So make sure to transfer this over before running the next simulation. Besides that all of your data should be stored in the folder you created, and you should be good for data analysis. "
